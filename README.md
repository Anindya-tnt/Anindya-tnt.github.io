Helps in taking notes while watching a MOOC video on the go. Enjoy MOOC lovers :)

## Alpha Release 1

Currently it is in testing phase. Features are being added while you sip coffee and make JAVA like programming languages yourself.

## Getting Started

Hit anindya-tnt.github.io to view a sample video taken from coursera.org Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, Stanford University.
As the video plays there are two things you can do. Either take a text note of what the instructor is saying or take a screenshot of the current keyframe of the video. Everything you add to your note will automatically be added to the Note panel below. The note is editable and downloadable as a MS Word file.
