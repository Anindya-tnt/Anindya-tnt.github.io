# MOOCbook - A revolutionary digital note taking assistant for MOOCs

Helps in taking notes while watching a MOOC video on the go. Enjoy MOOC lovers :)

## Alpha Release 1

Currently it is in testing phase. Features are being added while you sip coffee and make JAVA like programming languages yourself.

## Getting Started

Hit <a href="anindya-tnt.github.io">anindya-tnt.github.io</a> to view a sample video taken from coursera.org Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, Stanford University.
As the video plays there are two things you can do. Either take a text note of what the instructor is saying or take a screenshot of the current keyframe of the video. Everything you add to your note will automatically be added to the Note panel. The note is editable and downloadable as a MS Word file.

## video-js
The video player that is featured here is a result of hard work by Brightcove, Inc. Video.js is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world. It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through plugins). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over 50,000 100,000 200,000 400,000 websites.

## video-js-ga
Every action is recorded via google analytics thanks to plugin guy mickey at <a href="https://github.com/mickey/videojs-ga">https://github.com/mickey/videojs-ga</a> which is doubly awesome. This data will help in getting learner specific behaviour which will further enable to make changes to MOOC design that best suits the future. 

## summernote
This note thingy was possible because of the contributions of a geek community who dedicated significant hours of their lives towards building an online WYSIWYG editor via javascript. You can find them at <a href="https://github.com/summernote/summernote">https://github.com/summernote/summernote</a> 

## jquery-word-export
The note as it gets compiled is ready for download to the client via <a href="https://github.com/markswindoll/jQuery-Word-Export">https://github.com/markswindoll/jQuery-Word-Export</a> into a MS Word document. It is lightwight and aimed at achieving what it promises quite elegantly.
